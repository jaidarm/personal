            <p>I am a student at Iowa State University.
                I am studying a major in Software Engineering and a minor in Spanish.
                This is my third semester at Iowa State University.

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to developing a single Web page using
            only two technologies being HTML and CSS. The project consists of
            creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
            Navigation Bar. I have to include text describing ourself and
            text describing the project. Additionally, I need to include
            two images: one image is of myself and second image is anything
            related to the project itself.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>The second project I did was for a Code Camp in 2023. The project goal
                    was to make an app using Android Studio that has not been made before.
                    There were many aspects of the project such as style, format, and buttons.
